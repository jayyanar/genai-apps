Learn and Launch an Generative AI Application

## Step 1 - Complete the Prerequisties

- Ref: https://github.com/jayyanar/genai-apps/blob/main/prerequisites.md

- You need Sagemaker Studio Lab or Google Collab to run this Lab. - Sagemaker Studio Lab will take 1-5 days to get approved and Provisioned


## Lab 1: Word Embedding - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jayyanar/genai-apps/blob/main/lab1_word_embedding.ipynb) 
### You will learn how to create a word embeddings using Word2Vec for Word and Sentence, Use Cohere API to process the file. You can use Sagemaker Studio Lab or Google Collab for this Demos


## Lab 2: Prompt Engineering - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jayyanar/genai-apps/blob/main/lab2_prompt_engineering.ipynb) 

### You will learn basic of Prompt Engineering - Zero, FewShot Prompting, Also how to Generate Text, Summarize, Generate Code using LLM (Cohere API)


## Lab 3: Image Generation - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jayyanar/genai-apps/blob/main/lab3_gen_images.ipynb) 

### Imagination is your limit, You can Generate a Image of your Dream using Dreamstudio


## Lab 4: Read PDF using Langchain - [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jayyanar/genai-apps/blob/main/lab4_LangChain_Cohere_PDF_Study_App.ipynb)
